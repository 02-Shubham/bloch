This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## About the app

This project implements an interactive Bloch sphere what is a geometrical representation used to visualize the state of a qubit, the fundamental unit of quantum information. It maps the qubit state onto a point on a sphere, allowing an intuitive understanding of quantum superposition and phase. With its simple 3D model, the Bloch sphere helps bridge the gap between complex quantum concepts and visual learning, making it an essential tool for anyone studying quantum computing or quantum mechanics.

### Features
- **Quantum Gates**: Apply predefined quantum gates (X, Y, Z, H) or add custom gates.
- **Comprehensive Qubit State Representation**:  
  - View the qubit state as a vector inside the Bloch sphere.  
  - Displays the current state in the form:  
    **$a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle$**.  
  - Examine the stateâ€™s coordinates in euclidean space and angular representation.
- **History Tracking**: Undo actions with the history feature and share your progress.
- **Undo**: Undos an action.
- **Reset**: Resets to the deafault state.
